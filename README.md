‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/Anamitra-Sarkar/Astranova_AI.git](https://github.com/Anamitra-Sarkar/Astranova_AI.git)
cd Astranova_AI

2. Set Up the Backend
Install Poetry: If you don't have it, follow the official instructions at poetry.eustace.io.

Install Dependencies: Poetry will read the pyproject.toml file and install all necessary Python packages.

poetry install

3. Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project. This file will store your secret keys and API credentials.

Important: Do not commit the .env file to your repository. The .gitignore file should already be configured to ignore it.

# A strong, random string for Flask session security
SECRET_KEY='your_super_secret_flask_key'

# Your Google AI Studio API Key for Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_google_api_key'

# (Optional) Your Tavily API Key for the real-time search feature
TAVILY_API_KEY='your_tavily_api_key'

# Your Firebase Admin SDK credentials
# 1. Go to Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts
# 2. Click "Generate new private key"
# 3. Open the downloaded JSON file, copy its entire content.
# 4. Paste it into an online Base64 encoder and copy the resulting string.
# 5. Paste the Base64 string here.
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_B64='your_base64_encoded_firebase_service_account_key'

4. Run the Application
Activate the virtual environment:

poetry shell

Run the Flask server:

flask run

The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This application is configured for deployment on platforms like Render.

Build Command: poetry install
